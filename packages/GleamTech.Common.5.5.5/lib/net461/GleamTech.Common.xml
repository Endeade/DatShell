            <para>Note that Chrome 80+ allows SameSiteMode.None only if the cookie is also marked Secure and we will mark it Secure when the request is secure (HTTPS).
            So even with this fix if your cross-domain URL is not HTTPS, Chrome 80+ still does not allow the cookie in cross domain iframe (with default browser settings).
            Fix works on IE and Firefox even if your cross-domain URL is not HTTPS.

            Renders the required resource tags of JS includes (no CSS includes etc.) for one or more GleamTech components.
            This method can be preferred when you want to render only JS includes at the bottom of the page before before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag 
            and render only CSS includes inside &lt;head&gt; tag via calling <see cref="M:GleamTech.AspNet.Mvc.WebViewPageExtensions.RenderHeadWithoutJs(System.Web.Mvc.WebViewPage,GleamTech.AspNet.UI.Component,GleamTech.AspNet.UI.Component[])"/>.
            This practice of having CSS includes &lt;head&gt; and JS includes at the bottom before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag, 
            is for increasing browser loading and rendering of your whole page;
            i.e. the user sees your page with your styles at first glance while the JS files are being loaded in the background.
            This method should be called at the bottom of the page before before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag.
            If you call this method at some random place, the browser would misbehave.
            If you are rendering multiple GleamTech components in the same page, call this method once by passing
            all the component instances at once, this way the resources shared by all the components will be merged 
            and included in the page once.
            Make sure you are not calling this method multiple times and adding the result to the same page HTML,
            for example including the same JS file multiple times in the same page would cause browser errors.

            <summary>
            Renders and returns a string containing the required resource tags of JS includes (no CSS includes etc.) for multiple GleamTech components.
            This method can be preferred when you want to render only JS includes at the bottom of the page before before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag 
            and render only CSS includes inside &lt;head&gt; tag via calling <see cref="M:GleamTech.AspNet.UI.ComponentRenderer.RenderHead(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{GleamTech.AspNet.UI.Component},System.Boolean)"/> with withoutJs parameter set to true.
            This practice of having CSS includes &lt;head&gt; and JS includes at the bottom before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag, 
            is for increasing browser loading and rendering of your whole page;
            i.e. the user sees your page with your styles at first glance while the JS files are being loaded in the background.
            This method should be called at the bottom of the page before before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag.
            If you call this method at some random place, the browser would misbehave.
            If you are rendering multiple GleamTech components in the same page, call this method once by passing
            all the component instances at once, this way the resources shared by all the components will be merged 
            and included in the page once.
            Make sure you are not calling this method multiple times and adding the result to the same page HTML,
            for example including the same JS file multiple times in the same page would cause browser errors.

            Implement this property to indicate if a file with this provider can be serialized across processes and machines.
            For instance, a file on disk can be serialized because you only need path information to restore it but a
            file in memory is volatile, i.e. it cannot be restored on other machines.
            This property is mainly used by caching mechanisms, for deciding if a local copy of the file should be made.
            If the file is serializable, there will be no need for a local copy.

            Ensures GleamTech's assemblies are loaded and initialized.
            You may need to call this method in entry point/startup of your application, if you receive "Could not load file or assembly ..." errors.
            Some DLLs are embedded inside GleamTech's DLLs and they are resolved automatically when they are requested however
            internal AssemblyResolver should be initialized first and internal AssemblyResolver of each GleamTech DLL can be initialized
            only when a type inside that DLL is accessed first. So in some cases, even a GleamTech DLL is loaded, its AssemblyResolver
            may not be initialized yet (because none of its types is accessed yet). You can observe this behaviour if your application
            calls some methods which scans assemblies for reflection purpose (reflection-only type access does not trigger DLL's module initializer),
            for example ASP.NET Core's endpoints.MapControllers method and SimpleInjector’s RegisterMvcControllers method.
            So to prevent errors on those methods, you can call this method before such methods.
            Note that you should not need to call this method usually for web applications, because it is handled automatically
            as we can know when the application is started by hooking up (automatically in ASP.NET Classic and when you call AddGleamTech and
            UseGleamTech methods in ASP.NET Core).
